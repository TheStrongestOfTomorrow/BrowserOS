# browserOS 🚀 (v1.1.1)

Welcome to **browserOS**, a project born from the desire to push the boundaries of what's possible in a web browser. This isn't just another "portfolio site"—it's a fully-fledged, high-performance operating system environment designed for developers, gamers, and power users who live on the web.

## 🎨 The Vision
browserOS is built to be fast, beautiful, and functional. We've smashed together the best parts of macOS, Linux, and Windows to create a "vibe" that feels both familiar and futuristic. Whether you're "vibe-coding" with AI in Nexus IDE or slaying demons in Doom, browserOS is your digital playground.

## 🌟 What's New in v1.1.1? (The Developer Update)
- **Nexus IDE Pro+**: Added "Vibe Mode" for immersive AI coding, multi-file support, and integrated console.
- **API Tester**: A built-in tool for testing REST endpoints directly from the OS.
- **JSON Tool**: Quick format and minify utility for data structures.
- **Terminal Pro**: Added `mkdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `date`, and `whoami`.
- **Real Filesystem**: Persistent file creation and directory management.
- **Minor Bug Fixes**: Improved iframe stability and window management.

## 🛠️ Core Features
- **Nexus IDE**: AI-powered development with live preview.
- **Python Playground**: Real Python execution via Pyodide.
- **WASM Gaming**: Play classic titles like Doom at 60FPS.
- **Windowing System**: Multi-task like a pro with our custom window manager.
