# browserOS 🚀 (v1.1.0)

Welcome to **browserOS**, a project born from the desire to push the boundaries of what's possible in a web browser. This isn't just another "portfolio site"—it's a fully-fledged, high-performance operating system environment designed for developers, gamers, and power users who live on the web.

## 🎨 The Vision
browserOS is built to be fast, beautiful, and functional. We've smashed together the best parts of macOS, Linux, and Windows to create a "vibe" that feels both familiar and futuristic. Whether you're "vibe-coding" with AI in Nexus IDE or slaying demons in Doom, browserOS is your digital playground.

- **Dock Customization**: Pin and unpin your favorite apps.
- **Desktop Context Menu**: Right-click anywhere on the desktop for quick actions.
- **Nexus IDE Pro**: Multi-file support, integrated console, and code downloading.
- **Window Resizing**: Full control over your workspace layout.
- **New Apps**: YouTube, Whiteboard, Weather, and more.
