# browserOS 🚀 (v1.0.5)

Welcome to **browserOS**, a project born from the desire to push the boundaries of what's possible in a web browser. This isn't just another "portfolio site"—it's a fully-fledged, high-performance operating system environment designed for developers, gamers, and power users who live on the web.

## 🎨 The Vision
browserOS is built to be fast, beautiful, and functional. We've smashed together the best parts of macOS, Linux, and Windows to create a "vibe" that feels both familiar and futuristic. Whether you're "vibe-coding" with AI in Nexus IDE or slaying demons in Doom, browserOS is your digital playground.

## 🌟 What's New in v1.0.5?
- **UI Overhaul**: A complete visual refresh. Smoother transitions, better glassmorphism, and a more refined color palette.
- **The "Start" Experience**: The launcher is no longer just an app; it's an integrated system component that feels like a real OS menu.
- **Nexus IDE Upgrades**: Improved AI stability and better preview rendering.
- **Python Everywhere**: Enhanced Python support in the terminal and playground.
- **Bug Squashing**: Fixed critical issues with Doom and VS Code loading.

## 🛠️ Core Features
- **Nexus IDE**: AI-powered development with live preview.
- **Python Playground**: Real Python execution via Pyodide.
- **WASM Gaming**: Play classic titles like Doom at 60FPS.
- **Windowing System**: Multi-task like a pro with our custom window manager.
