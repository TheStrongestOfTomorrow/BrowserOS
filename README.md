# browserOS 🚀 (v1.2.0)

Welcome to **browserOS**, a project born from the desire to push the boundaries of what's possible in a web browser. This isn't just another "portfolio site"—it's a fully-fledged, high-performance operating system environment designed for developers, gamers, and power users who live on the web.

## 🎨 The Vision
browserOS is built to be fast, beautiful, and functional. We've smashed together the best parts of macOS, Linux, and Windows to create a "vibe" that feels both familiar and futuristic. Whether you're "vibe-coding" with AI in Nexus IDE or slaying demons in Doom, browserOS is your digital playground.
